    "# Classes and Objects in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented programming language that offers classes, which are a potent tool for writing reusable code. To describe objects with shared characteristics and behaviours, classes are utilised. We shall examine Python's ideas of classes and objects in this article.\n",

    "__Classes in Python:__\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a class is a user-defined data type that contains both the data itself and the methods that may be used to manipulate it. In a sense, classes serve as a template to create objects. They provide the characteristics and operations that the objects will employ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a class is a prototype of a building. A building contains all the details about the floor, rooms, doors, windows, etc. we can make as many buildings as we want, based on these details. Hence, the building can be seen as a class, and we can create as many objects of this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Creating Classes in Python__\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a class can be created by using the keyword class, followed by the class name. The syntax to create a class is given below.\n",

    "In Python, we must notice that each class is associated with a documentation string which can be accessed by using <class-name>.__doc__. A class contains a statement suite including fields, constructor, function, etc. definition.    \n",

You may combine information and capabilities into a single entity that is able to be used to build many objects by establishing a class. Using the dot notation, you may access an object's methods and properties after it has been created. You can develop more logical, effective, and manageable code by comprehending Python's classes and objects."
