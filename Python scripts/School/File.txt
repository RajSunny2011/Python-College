Hi! how do you do?
I am fine. How about you?
Great man, the weather is mighty fine.
How are the dogs doing? Long time since I met them.
Great, Fubo had a fracture a week ago but he is recovering.
I hope he recovers quickly.
The doctor said it will take a few weeks before he can run well.
That's great. How did it happen anyways?
It was just that the Sith attacked.
Oh, Star wars has fallen in quality a lot.
